            From ancient Bharat to modern India, higher education has always
            occupied a place of prominence in Indian history. In ancient times,
            Nalanda, Taxila and Vikramsila universities were renowned seats of
            higher learning, attracting students not only from all over the
            country but from far off countries like Korea, China, Burma (now
            Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Tibet and Nepal. Today, India
            manages one of the largest higher education systems in the world*.

            The present system of higher education dates back to Mountstuart
            Elphinstone`s minutes of 1823, which stressed on the need for
            establishing schools for teaching English and the European sciences.
            Later, Lord Macaulay, in his minutes of 1835, advocated "efforts to
            make natives of the country thoroughly good English scholars". Sir
            Charles Wood`s Dispatch of 1854, famously known as the ` Magna Carta
            o f English Education in India`, recommended creating a properly
            articulated scheme of education from the primary school to the
            university. It sought to encourage indigenous education and planned
            the formulation of a coherent policy of education. Subsequently, the
            universities of Calcutta, Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras were set up
            in 1857, followed by the university of Allahabad in 1887.

            The Inter-University Board (later known as the Association of Indian
            Universities) was established in 1925 to promote university
            activities, by sharing information and cooperation in the field of
            education, culture, sports and allied areas.

            The first attempt to formulate a national system of education in
            India came In 1944, with the Report of the Central Advisory Board of
            Education on Post War Educational Development in India, also known
            as the Sargeant Report. It recommended the formation of a University
            Grants Committee, which was formed in 1945 to oversee the work of
            the three Central Universities of Aligarh, Banarasand Delhi. In
            1947, the Committee was entrusted with the responsibility of dealing
            with all the then existing Universities.

            Soon after Independence, the University Education Commission was set
            up in 1948 under the Chairmanship of Dr. S Radhakrishnan "to report
            on Indian university education and suggest improvements and
            extensions that might be desirable to suit the present and future
            needs and aspirations of the country". It recommended that the
            University Grants Committee be reconstituted on the general model of
            the University Grants Commission of the United Kingdom with a
            full-time Chairman and other members to be appointed from amongst
            educationists of repute.

            In 1952, the Union Government decided that all cases pertaining to
            the allocation of grants-in-aid from public funds to the Central
            Universities and other Universities and Institutions of higher
            learning might be referred to the University Grants Commission.
            Consequently, the University Grants Commission (UGC) was formally
            inaugurated by late Shri Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the then Minister
            of Education, Natural Resources and Scientific Research on 28
            December 1953.

            The UGC, however, was formally established only in November 1956 as
            a statutory body of the Government of India through an Act of
            Parliament for the coordination, determination, and maintenance of
            standards of university education in India. The offices of the UGC
            are located in three locations in Delhi: Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in
            New Delhi, 35, Feroze Shah Road, and the South Campus of the
            University of Delhi.
